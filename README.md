![TASK 14A SCREENSHOT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b52f5dba-07c7-4a60-852e-b87787bcaba8)
The findings of this analysis reveal a continuous rise in asylum-seekers and refugees worldwide, reinforcing the urgent need for strategic policy interventions and strengthened global collaboration. Addressing IDP challenges and statelessness requires a comprehensive, long-term approach that balances humanitarian support with sustainable development. By leveraging data-driven insights, policymakers and stakeholders can take a more informed and structured approach to managing the global refugee crisis.

OBSERVATIONS: 
The number of asylum-seekers increased from 4,148,141 in 2019 to 4,616,135 in 2021, reflecting a consistent rise in forced displacement. 
Refugees under UNHCRâ€™s mandate rose to 21,327,285 in 2021, underscoring the increasing burden on host nations and international aid organizations.
Afghanistan remains a leading source of refugees, with significant asylum-seeker populations in Egypt, Argentina, and Armenia.
Countries like Egypt and Argentina have received a growing number of asylum-seekers, despite their relatively smaller total refugee populations.
Afghanistan recorded 2,553,390 IDPs of concern to UNHCR, highlighting internal conflicts as a major displacement driver.

Recommendations To address the ongoing refugee crisis, the following steps are recommended:
Governments and international organizations must collaborate to implement fair refugee burden-sharing mechanisms.
Financial aid and policy frameworks should be enhanced to help countries integrate refugees effectively.
A sustainable approach to IDP reintegration and refugee resettlement is necessary to reduce prolonged displacement.
Greater efforts should be made to track and provide legal recognition to stateless individuals to prevent their exclusion from basic rights and services.
